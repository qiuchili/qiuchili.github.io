This paper describes our system (MSIIP THU) used for Topic-Based Chinese
Message Polarity Classification Task in
SIGHAN-8. In our system, a lexiconbased classifier and a statistical machine
learning-based classifier are built up, followed by a linear combination of these two models. The overall performance of
the proposed framework ranks in the middle of all terms participating in the task.
