We provide a novel perspective on conversational emotion recognition by drawing an analogy between the task and a complete span of quantum measurement. We characterize different steps of quantum measurement in the process of recognizing speakers' emotions in conversation, and stitch them up with a quantum-like neural network. The quantum-like layers are implemented by complex-valued operations to ensure an authentic adoption of quantum concepts, which naturally enables conversational context modeling and multimodal fusion. We borrow an existing algorithm to learn the complex-valued network weights, so that the quantum-like procedure is conducted in a data-driven manner. Our model is comparable to state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmarking datasets, and provide a quantum view to understand conversational emotion recognition.
